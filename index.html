    <h1>Grizzly</h1>
    <p>Grizzly "Grizz" Bear is one of the three main protagonists (alongside Panda and Ice Bear) of We Bare Bears. He is the oldest brother of the Bears. Being a grizzly bear, he is familiar with the forest area that the Bears live in. He is the leader of the three and is seen as such.</p>

    <div class="box2">
    <h1>Ice bear</h1>
    <p>Ice Bear is one of the three main protagonists in We Bare Bears. Ice Bear is the youngest of the trio, but is, undoubtedly, the strongest, the cleverest, and, in some respects, the most mature of them. He was able to rescue his older brothers from certain death without too much hassle and is quick to jump into action if he finds a threat arising. He cares for both of his brothers dearly. He tends to do most of the chores of the house, though he doesn't seem to mind this. Despite his willingness to pitch in where the others don't, he still takes days off to relax and unwind.</p>

    <div class="box3">
    <h1>Panda</h1>
    <p>Panda Bear is one of the three main protagonists of We Bare Bears. He seems to have more knowledge about things regarding technology and things from Asian culture. He is the middle brother and, as stated by Grizzly, is "the link that holds them all, together". He is Charlie's best friend, but he doesn't want to admit it. Although, he did admit it in "Panda's Art". He is to be the most delicate of the trio, being both quite anxious and, as Grizzly also described, "cute". Even so, he does care about his brothers and will try to pitch in whenever and however he can.</p>
